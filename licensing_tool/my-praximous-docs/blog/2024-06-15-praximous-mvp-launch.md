We are thrilled to announce the official MVP (Minimum Viable Product) launch of **Praximous**!

Praximous is set to revolutionize how enterprises interact with AI by providing a secure, on-premise AI gateway. Our mission is to empower businesses with full control over their AI usage, ensuring data security, cost management, and operational resilience without vendor lock-in.

## What is Praximous?

In today's rapidly evolving AI landscape, businesses face significant challenges:

*   üí∏ **Uncontrolled Costs:** The expense of using powerful third-party LLMs can quickly escalate.
*   üîê **Data Security & Privacy:** Sending sensitive enterprise data to external AI services poses significant risks.
*   üß± **Vendor Lock-In:** Relying on a single AI provider can limit flexibility and increase dependency.
*   üß© **Development Complexity:** Integrating and managing various AI models and custom logic can be a heavy lift for development teams.

Praximous addresses these challenges head-on by offering:

*   **Smart Skill Platform:** Develop and deploy modular, business-specific logic units that can operate independently or in conjunction with LLMs.
*   **Resilient Failover Architecture:** Configure primary and secondary LLM providers (e.g., Gemini with failover to a local Ollama instance) for uninterrupted service.
*   **Secure On-Premise Deployment:** Keep your data within your environment using Docker.
*   **Pluggable Provider Architecture:** Easily switch between different LLM providers through simple configuration changes.
*   **Comprehensive Auditing & Analytics:** Track every interaction for full traceability and optimization insights.
*   **Centralized API Gateway:** A single, stable endpoint for all your internal applications.
*   **Context-Aware Persona:** Define a unique identity for your gateway to ensure consistent AI interactions.
